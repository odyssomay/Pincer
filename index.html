			<h1>Pincer</h1>
			<img src="images/logo.png">
			<p id="intro">Pincer is a kit for developing clojurescript sites.
			It contains a few scripts, some useful code, and some boilerplate.</p>
			<h2>Getting started</h2>
			<p>Start by cloning the pincer repository 
			<span class="inline-code">git clone git://github.com/odyssomay/Pincer.git</span></p>
			<p>To install the dependencies, run <span class="inline-code">npm install</span>
			(npm is part of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>).</p>
			<p>To start working run <span class="inline-code">sh scripts/main.sh</span>. It is
			important that this is done from the pincer root directory.</p>
			<p>If you haven't got any error messages, it's all good to go!
			Point your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>
			and verify that everything is working properly.</p>
			<h2>Folders</h2>
			<p>The folders determine the structure of the application - how everything is layed out.</p>
			<div id="folder-structure">
				pincer
				<div class="folder-content">
					internals<br>
					partials<br>
					public<br>
					<div class="folder-content">
						css<br>
						js<br>
					</div>
					scripts<br>
					src<br>
					<div class="folder-content">
						app<br>
						server<br>
					</div>
					views
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>This outline is there to get an overview of what parts the application
			you create consists of. The content of the folders will be explained in detailed below.</p>
			<h2>Views</h2>
			<p>A view is an html file that you want to load from the browser. That is, in the same way
			that you would load a page from a static file server.</p>
			<p>Views must be placed in the <span class="inline-code">views</span> directory. When in the <span class="inline-code">views</span> directory, they
			can be loaded in the browser with the path <span class="inline-code">/page/:name</span>, where <span class="inline-code">:name</span> is the name of the view.
			For example, if a file called <span class="inline-code">test.html</span> is placed in the <span class="inline-code">views</span> directory, it can be reached
			in the browser with <span class="inline-code">/page/test</span>.</p>
			<h2>Internals</h2>
			<p>Internals are exactly the same as views, but they are meant to be loaded from the current page.
			They are used to create a one page application. Note that you can mix views and internals
			however you like, meaning your application can mix the concepts of multiple page versus one page applications.</p>
			<h2>Partials</h2>
			<p>Partials are again, exactly the same as views, but they can only be imported from views or internals.
			This is used for parts that are shared between pages.</p>
			<h2>Libraries</h2>
			<p>Libraries, or add-ons, if you so will. Are small files which add commonly needed functionality.</p>
			<p>
			<table>
				<tr><td><p><a href="/lib/auth.html">auth</a></p></td><td><p>Some framework for user authentication</p></td></tr>
				<tr><td><p><a href="/lib/socket_auth.html">socket auth</a></p></td><td><p>Socket.io with authentication.</p></td></tr>
				<tr><td><p><a href="/lib/chat.html">chat</a></p></td><td><p>Utilities to easily create multiple chat instances.</p></td></tr>
			</table>
			</p>
			<h2>Repl</h2>
			<h2>Server</h2>
			<p>Now that you know how to use and take advantage of the code already provided, it's 
			time to take an initial closer look at the underlying code.</p>
